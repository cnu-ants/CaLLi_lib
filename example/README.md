# Getting Started

## Initialization

The Init module facilitates the conversion of input LLVM bitcode into Calli 
Intermediate Representation (IR) recognized by the Calli analyzer. 
Moreover, Loop Unrolling can be applied to LLVM bitcode through LLVM Pass as input.
Users have the flexibility to employ various transformation features provided by 
Calli, such as 'call instruction transformation,' 'prune node insertion,' 'select 
node insertion,' 'exit node insertion,' and more, according to their specific 
requirements.

```
let _ = 
  let _ = Init.init () in 
  let _ = Init.loop_unroll 3 () in
  let _ = Init.transform_call () in
  let _ = Init.transform_select () in
  let _ = Init.transform_prune () in
  let _ = Init.make_llm () in
  let _ = Init.make_call_graph () in ()
```

## User Definition

1) Abstract Value

The abstract value in CaLLi represents the abstraction of values within a program. CaLLi provides infterface for abstract value module.

```
module type S =
  
  sig
    type elt
    type t

    val bot : t
    val top : t
    val (<=) : t -> t -> bool
    val join : t -> t -> t
    val meet : t -> t -> t
    val widen : t -> t -> t

    val alpha : elt -> string -> t

    val binop : Op.t -> t -> t -> string -> t
    val compop : Cond.t -> t -> t -> string -> t

    val pp : Format.formatter -> t -> unit

  end
```

The abstract value includes the smallest value 'bot' and biggest value 'top'.
The binary operation binop and comparison compop functions take an operator and two abstract values, and return an abstract value as the operation result.
Additionally, functions for calculating partial order(âŠ‘) between values, as well as join, meet and widen functions, need to be implemented.


2) Analysis Context

The analysis context module support context-sensitive analysis. 

```
module type S = sig
  type t type memty
  val empty : t
  val apply : Ast.BasicBlock.t -> Ast.BasicBlock.t list -> t -> memty -> (Ast.
end
```

The 'apply' functions to create new contexts using the current basicblock, context, 
and abstract memory which is the analysis result. It then applies the new context 
to the next basicblocks or selects the next basicblocks based on the new context.

CaLLi provides a callsite context module by default. 
The following is part of the apply function within the callsite context in Calli.

```
  ...
match current_bb.term with
| CallSite _ ->
  List.map (fun bb -> (bb, push current_bb.bb_name current_ctxt)) next_bb_list 
  ...     
```

In the callsite context, when encountering a function call in the form of a 
CallSite command, the apply function generates a new context by pushing the 
current basic block name onto the current context (call stack). It then applies
 this new context to the successors in the next_bb_list of the current basic 
 block.

Users can implement the apply function according to their analysis goals to create a context module tailored to their specific needs.


3) Transfer Function

The transfer function in CaLLi plays a crucial role in the analysis process. It is an implementation of abstract semantics. It takes a basicblock and abstract memory as input and returns a new abstract memory.

```
module type S = sig
  type memty
  val transfer : Ast.BasicBlock.t -> memty -> memty
end
```

For example, the following code represents the transfer function for BinaryOperation commands. It calculates the values of each operand, performs the operation, and then updates the Env and AbsMemory with the resulting value.

```
| BinaryOp {name; op; operand0; operand1; _} ->
  let v1 = abs_eval operand0 mem in
  let v2 = abs_eval operand1 mem in
  let res : AbsValue1.t = AbsValue1.binop op v1 v2 name in
  let addr = stmt.bb_name^(string_of_int stmt.index)^(string_of_int 0) in
  let _ = Env.env := Env.add name addr !Env.env in
  AbsMemory.update addr res mem
```


## Building Analyzer

Utilizing the provided Functor in Calli, it is essential to generate the absmemory 
and states modules crucial for the creation of the analyzer.

```
module MyAbsMemory = AbstractMemory.Make(MyAbsValue)
module MyStates = States.Make (MyContext) (MyAbsMemory)
module Analyzer = WtoAnalyzer.Make (MyAbsValue) (MyAbsMemory) (MyContext) (MyStates) (MyTF)
```

Finally, users can create an analyzer by using the Functor of the CalliAnalyzer module.

```
module Analyzer1 = WlAnalyzer.Make (MyAbsValue) (MyAbsMemory) (MyContext) (MyStates) (MyTF)
module Analyzer2 = WtoAnalyzer.Make (MyAbsValue) (MyAbsMemory) (MyContext) (MyStates) (MyTF)

```


## Performing Analysis

The user can perform analysis using the analyzer created through the Functor. 
Initially, the analyzer is initialized with the AST transformed into Calli IR.
Set the starting basicblock for analysis and configure the initial the abstract memory.

```
  let init_mem = Analyzer.init (Init.m ())  in 
  let main = Module.main (Init.llmodule ()) in
  let entry = Bbpool.find (main.function_name^"#"^"entry") !Bbpool.pool in
  let init_states = States.update (entry, MyContext.empty ()) init_mem States.empty in
  
```

User can set the loop count to be utilized in the iteration algorithm.
Ultimately, analysis can be performed through the analyze module of the analyzer.

```
let _ = Analyzer.LoopCounter.set_max_count 5 in
let _ = Analyzer.analyze init_states in
let res = !Analyzer.summary in
```
